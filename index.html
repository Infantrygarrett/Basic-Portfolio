                    Hi! My name is John Garrett. I really like to solve puzzels and build new things. That is why I enrolled in the Bootcamp. I 
                    hope to find a job once I graduate that will challenge me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a one year old son and two dumb dogs. My son's name is also John and my dogs are Ringo and Bono. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time I enjoy working on cars. I have a few that I am currently working on now. That is why I need a good job so I can fuel my hobbie.
                </p>
